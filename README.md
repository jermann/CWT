# CWT
**Implementation and Reports of Deep Neural Network Framework for Multi-Label Text Classification**

CWT is deep learning text classification algorithm based on [Magpie](https://github.com/inspirehep/magpie). It was developed at [Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP](www.cadwalader.com) during my internship for their legal technolgy platform [Cadwalader Cabinet](https://www.findknowdo.com/) to label legal documents. Due to proprietary information, I cannot publish the project that I developed for the firm. I am however happy to outline the general approach to the problem I was given to solve with this project.
